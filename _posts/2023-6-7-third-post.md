- When I arrived at the office, I searched for information on Markdown and came across a helpful website that provided guidance on certain aspects. Following that, I had a call with my mentors, and together we made my website public.
- Afterwards, I proceeded to add various elements to my website, such as links and blog posts. Subsequently, I had a call with my coworkers, who showcased their own websites and offered me valuable tips.
- For the remainder of the day, I dedicated my time to working on my website, making minor additions. I also explored the process of adding images and themes, although I haven't managed to make it work just yet.
