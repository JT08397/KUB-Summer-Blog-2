- I began my day by attending a meeting where my webpage design was reviewed, and I received instructions to create two additional designs along with some helpful tips. 
- I immediately got to work, focusing on the first design by opting for a longer, darker, and cooler theme. For the second design, I incorporated more colors and adopted a creative approach to the placements. 
- While working on the designs, I had the opportunity to meet up with one of my friends from the teamwork program and enjoyed lunch together. After completing the second design, I headed home, concluding my day.
