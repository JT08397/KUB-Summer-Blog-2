- Upon arriving at the office, I got into my new design project, dedicating a few hours to its development. However, my work was interrupted when it was time for lunch. After enjoying my meal break, I returned to the office with the intention of continuing my design work. Unfortunately, circumstances required me to leave for the day before I could complete the design.
