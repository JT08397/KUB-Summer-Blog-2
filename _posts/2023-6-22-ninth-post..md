- Today, I had another KUB tour, returning to the same location as last time. We began by visiting the waste management facility, where they provided us with a comprehensive tour. They explained the process of handling waste, including where it goes and how they treat wastewater. Subsequently, we proceeded to another area where similar tasks were carried out. This particular location had multiple buildings, each dedicated to different aspects of cleaning and power systems.
- Our next stop was the laboratory, where they showcased how wastewater looks up close and demonstrated the process of purifying water. They also introduced us to tiny microorganisms involved in the purification process. Following the lab visit, we enjoyed some pizza for lunch.
- After our meal, we moved on to the section where the powerline maintenance crew operates. They emphasized the importance of caution and discussed the inherent risks of their job. They shared stories about incidents where equipment on power lines malfunctioned and caused explosions, highlighting the misconceptions people often have about the challenges and dangers of their work.
- Eventually, I was dropped off at my workplace, where I focused on my webpage design and added this post to my blog.
