- I began my day by working on the fifth design iteration of the webpage. In this version, I positioned the backflow and Cross connections sections right next to each other for better visual cohesion. Once I completed that task, 
- I shifted my focus to writing the script for the end-of-summer video project. I wanted to ensure it captured the essence of the season effectively.
- After finalizing the script, I proceeded to update my blog with the latest content and reflections from the day. With my work for the day completed, I wrapped up and headed home.
