- I started today with some meetings, but I didn't really do anything in them because they had nothing to do with me. After that, which only took around 40 minutes, I asked Jacob about some things with my website, and he helped me fix them. After that, I was really done with it. 
- Then I had a call with Jacob, and he talked about coding PR stuff and how editing the KUB apps works and stuff. Then I partnered with Leah, one of my coworkers, as she worked on her maps. Soon after, we went to lunch where I didn't bring a lunch today, so I just sat until my other coworker, Bella, went on a walk, and I went with her. 
- After getting back from lunch, I got on a call with Lucas and my mentors, and he went over the new plan. He wanted me to remake the Cross Connections KUB page and show it off so we can put it on the real site. I got started on that, and now I am done with making the layout of it.
