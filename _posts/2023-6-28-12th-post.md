- Today, I had the luxury of sleeping in for an extra hour as I didn't need to be at work until 9 am. Upon arriving at work, I joined my team members to have discussions with various managers at KUB. 
- We would spend approximately 20 minutes with each manager, and while the topics often overlapped, they primarily revolved around introductions, my educational background, my role in ISD (Information Systems Department), and my aspirations for the future.
- After completing these meetings, we took a break to have lunch, coinciding with our final meeting. However, I finished earlier than expected because the person who was supposed to accompany me was no longer available. Following the meetings, I dedicated my time to working on my design tasks and making updates to my blog until my departure at 2 pm.
