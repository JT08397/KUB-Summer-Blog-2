- I began my day by working on two new designs, and the process took me until around 12:30 PM to complete them. After, I took a break to meet up with a friend. We spent some time talking and hanging out outside.
- Then, I helped in setting up for the team workers' ice cream social event. Once the preparations were done, I hung out with my friends while waiting for the social to officially begin.
- After about 30 minutes, we entered the event venue to kick off the ice cream social. I engaged in conversations with people and participated in a game were u hand to see who could grab the cup the fastest. We then had the ice cream, and I got the vanilla flavor. I spent some time chatting with my friends during this enjoyable experience.
- Later, I accompanied my friend to his workplace so that he could retrieve his belongings before leaving. After saying our goodbyes, I returned to the office and finished up my design tasks before wrapping up for the day.
