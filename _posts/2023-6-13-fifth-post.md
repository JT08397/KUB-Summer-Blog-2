- I arrived here and proceeded to work on my website further. I began by making adjustments to the Project tab. Unfortunately, I accidentally broke it, but after some attempts to fix it, I managed to resolve the issue and bring everything back together.
- Next, I took the time to correct the grammar in all of my previous posts. Following that, I addressed a few minor issues before moving on to my next task, which involved working on the Picture tab. I added some older pictures there, and in the future, I will place new pictures in the same location. Finally, I created today's post and concluded my work for the day.
