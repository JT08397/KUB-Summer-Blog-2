- Today, I went on a tour of the Middle Brook KUB location with my KUB team workers. We started by going to the auditorium where we met up with everyone. Once everyone had arrived, we proceeded to the first area, which is where they print out the bills. They showed us the equipment they use for printing and cutting the paper. After that, we visited the community service area where they handle calls and assist people. I asked them if they ever receive prank calls, and one of the staff members mentioned she had never received one.
- Next, we went upstairs to the IST area where I work. I saw Anthony and had a conversation about how they develop the apps and websites for KUB. They also showed us how they assign job roles and showcased my website. We then moved on to the weather tracking area, where they demonstrated how they monitor pipes in Knoxville and the risks associated with rain and storms.
- Afterwards, we went outside to observe the electrical system workers. Unfortunately, they couldn't allow us in because we didn't have PPD (Personal Protective Equipment). The worker explained the importance of safety due to the potential for accidents and how weather can impact the system. He also shared a story about his former boss who had an accident, resulting in a broken back and third-degree burns.
- We then visited some other offices before heading to the mall for lunch.
