- Today, I arrived at work and immediately attended my first meeting. Following the meeting, I noticed that my second meeting had been rescheduled to 9:30. With some free time available, I resumed working on my webpage until the next meeting.
- Once 9:30 arrived, everyone gathered in the meeting room, and it turned out to be my first in-person meeting since starting this job. During the meeting, I was asked to showcase the progress I had made on my webpage so far. Everyone was nice about it and gave me good feed back and ideas.
- Motivated by the positive feedback, I continued working on my webpage, adding a new design and addressing any issues that needed fixing. Subsequently, I updated my blog, covering the events of both today and yesterday. With my tasks for the day completed, I wrapped up my work.
