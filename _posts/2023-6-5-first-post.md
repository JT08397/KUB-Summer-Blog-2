- I arrived at the KUB Conference Center at 8:00 am and sat around for a little while, waiting for everyone to arrive. Once everyone was present, various topics were discussed, including safety. During that time, we had our pictures taken and received our KUB cards.
- Afterward, my mentor Lucas picked me up, and we headed to the building where I would be working. Upon reaching the building, we went upstairs, and I was introduced to the individuals with whom I would be sharing the workspace. They were all UT students and seemed really cool. Shortly after, I met my other mentors, Jacob, Jayden, and Anthony.
- They gave me a tour of the building, and I had my office set up. I encountered many people during this process, including a woman who skydives and hangs off planes.
- Next, I completed some paperwork and began setting up my workstation, which proved to be challenging and time-consuming. There were aspects of it that I didn't quite understand. Fortunately, one of my coworkers, Jake, provided a lot of help, and I managed to finish it within a day. As the day was coming to an end, Lucas put up my nameplate, officially making me a part of the team.
