- After a couple of hours trying to get my website to have a theme. I learned I had to restart if I wanted to use the theme I liked. So I restarted and was mostly able to do it all by myself and get the website up and running quickly. Then I went on break and went on a workers with some coworkers outside. After are work I added post, pictures, about me, links, and more to my website. After that it was time to go home so I left fot the day.
