- After spending a couple of hours attempting to apply a theme to my website, I discovered that I would need to restart in order to use the theme I want. So, I decided to restart and, for the most part, managed to accomplish the task by myself, getting the website up and running swiftly. Following that, I took a break and went on a walk outdoors with some coworkers.
- Upon returning to work, I added posts, pictures, an "about me" section, links, and more to my website. With these additions completed, it was time to wrap up for the day, so I left the office.
